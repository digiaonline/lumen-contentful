This is a basic Lumen service provider for the Contentful PHP SDK. Version 1.x of this library is compatible with
version 2.x of the SDK, while version 2.x of this library is compatible with version 3.x of the SDK. Starting from
version 4.x the library version follows the SDK version, so version 4.x of this library is compatible with version 4.x
of the SDK.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.0
* Lumen 5.x

## Installation

Install the library:

```bash
composer require nordsoftware/lumen-contentful
```

Register the service provider:

```php
$app->register(Nord\Lumen\Contentful\ContentfulServiceProvider::class);
```

Finally, copy `config/contentful.php` to your application's `config/` directory, then define the environment variables
in your `.env` file. Certain more esoteric options cannot be configured through the configuration file, see the Usage
section for more information.

## Usage

Inject `Nord\Lumen\Contentful\ContentfulServiceContract` into your classes, then you'll be able to access the
Contentful client by using the `getClient()` method:

```php
<?php

use Nord\Lumen\Contentful\ContentfulServiceContract;

class TestService
{

    public function __construct(ContentfulServiceContract $contentfulService)
    {
        $client = $contentfulService->getClient();
    }
}
```

### Advanced usage

The Contentful SDK client takes a `ClientOption` parameter that controls various behavior such as which API to use,
caching and so on. If you need to deviate from the default options you will have to extend `ContentfulServiceProvider`
and override the `createClientOptions` method. Make sure to also register your custom service provider instead of the
one from the library.

If you need need to use a custom client completely, override `createClient`.
